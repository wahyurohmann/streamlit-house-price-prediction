🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning  
Mini Bootcamp Digicamp X Data Science Indonesia – Hands-on Project

📌 Project Overview
This project is a hands-on implementation of a House Price Prediction system developed during the Mini Bootcamp by Digistar.  
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model capable of predicting house prices based on several features and deploy the model as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

Through this project, participants gained practical experience in the End-to-end machine learning workflow, from collecting data to deployment. This model file create by Kak Ilham to be deployment practice

This model deploy to streamlit app that connect to github. You can access my deployment website via this link below 👇
